Overview

In this project, it simulates quantum qubits and quantum gates using the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It demonstrates the application of quantum gates, in particular the Hadamard gate and the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, to quantum states represented as complex vectors. The program also performs measurements to collapse quantum states and displays the results in both binary and decimal formats.
